From this link you can zoom in the underlying resource types. For example under Amazon EC2 you can find 
AWS::EC2::Instance under that you find all the properties of the ec2 instance resource s.a. InstanceType, 
SecurityGroups for each property it shows if it is a required property for the resource or not.
